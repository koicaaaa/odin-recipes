        <h1>Nana's Pasta Sauce</h1>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 to 2 cloves of garlic, finely diced or minced</li>
            <li>1 to 2 'Ausilio Thin Skin Italian' peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>1 chopped carrot</li>
            <li>1 chopped celery stalk</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced or minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of red wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 6-ounce can of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 15-ounce can of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 to 2 pinches of crushed Ausilio pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 to 2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 pinches of fresh basi, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add three tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add chopped vegetables (carrot, celery, Ausilio peppers, and diced onions) and sauté until soft. Stir in entire cans of crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, add water a little at a time—for each can (one each of crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste added to the sauce), fill the can with water and add to the pot. Add garlic, red wine, salt, and black pepper. Mix in one tablespoon of white sugar, then mix all ingredients, and then partially cover the pan with the lid. Simmer on low heat for 2.5 to 3 hours. Continue to check on sauce, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check and make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pot—do not burn the sauce. Add another tablespoon of white sugar. If the sauce is too tart for your taste, feel free to add a little more sugar.</li>
            <li>Save the fresh basil, pepper flakes, and bay leaves to add to the pot last. Simmer and stir often on low for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste and then season with additional salt and black pepper if needed. Pour over your favorite pasta and serve. Remember to include some Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, fresh Italian bread, and vino!</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
